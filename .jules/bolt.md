## 2024-05-31 - [Mongoose Query Optimization]
**Learning:** Adding `.lean()` to Mongoose queries returns plain JavaScript objects, significantly reducing memory and CPU usage for read-only operations. In this application, read-only queries were returning full Mongoose documents needlessly.
**Action:** Always verify if a `.find()` operation needs to return full Mongoose documents. Use `.lean()` when documents are strictly meant for read-only serialization.
